## Motivation :
This project is the extension of [My Previous Project](https://github.com/srinathsai/Google-pagerank-algorithm-on-Wikipedia). Here, we use a more specific algorithm called **Personalized Pagerank Algorithm** . Personalized PageRank is a variation of PageRank that computes PageRank relative to a particular vertex or set of vertices. So, I used this concept in a goal for better recommendation of movies for each user. That implies here the particular vertices or set of nodes for personalized recommendations are users.
